learning of data structures and algorithms 

Linear search: 
     Time complexity - O(n), where n is the size of the input data. This means that the time taken by the algorithm grows linearly with the input size. Space                complexity -   O(1), as it only requires a single variable to keep track of the current position in the search.

Binary search: 
    Time complexity - O(log n), where n is the size of the input data. This means that the time taken by the algorithm grows logarithmically with the input size. Space     complexity - O(1), as it only requires a few variables to keep track of the current position in the search and the bounds of the search space.

Bubble sort: 
    Time complexity - O(n^2), where n is the size of the input data. This means that the time taken by the algorithm grows as the square of the input size. Space           complexity - O(1), as it only requires a single auxiliary variable to perform the swaps.

Quick sort: 
    Time complexity - O(n log n) on average, O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the size of the input data. This means that the time taken by the algorithm grows         logarithmically with the input size on average, but can grow as the square of the input size in the worst case. Space complexity - O(log n) in the best case, O(n)     in the worst case, as it requires a small amount of stack space to store the recursive calls.

These are just a few examples of time and space complexity. The exact complexity of an algorithm depends on many factors, such as the size of the input data, the distribution of the data, and the specific implementation of the algorithm.
